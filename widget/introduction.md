# Getting started

**Arkane Widget** is a javascript SDK specifically designed to perform common blockchain tasks. It is created as a way to perform tasks that are otherwise not possible due to security implications \(e.g: creating signatures\). Arkane Widget wraps all of Arkaneâ€™s functionalities within a JavaScript layer in order to facilitate development.
