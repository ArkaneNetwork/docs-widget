# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

Arkane allows you to easily integrate your app with several blockchains, whether you already have an app integrated with web3 or are building a new application from scratch. Arkane provides a smooth and delightful experience for you, your users on both web and mobile.

Our products will help you interact with blockchain, create blockchain wallets, create different asset types such as fungible \(ERC20\), and non-fungible tokens \(ERC721, and ERC1155\), and interact with smart contracts. Next to a superior developer experience, you can give your users a user-friendly interface.

Each application is unique and has different needs, therefore we provide different ways of interacting with Arkane. Applications that have support for Web3 are recommended to integrate our [Web3 provider](web3-provider/getting-started.md), others are suggested to use the [Widget \(Arkane Connect\)](widget/introduction.md).
